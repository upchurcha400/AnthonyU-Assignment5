# Assignment 5 starter

## Use the Easy Way - Import as Maven Project

This is a couple minutes of work once you learn the system (which you will be doing anyway)

- Use this template to create `Assignment5` in your own github
- Clone that down to your bootcamp workspace
- In Eclipse, import this as a Maven project
- Skip the first 6 minutes of the Assignment 5 video
- Go to work


## Use the older way as course videos show

- Clone this project, but only as a source for the 2 java files you need
- Follow Trevor's video
