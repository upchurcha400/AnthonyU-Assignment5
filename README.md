Custom ArrayList Implementation:  

Added CustomArrayList class with basic add, get, and getSize methods. 

Handles dynamic resizing when the array gets full. 

Tested it out by adding more than 10 elements, making sure it grows as needed. 

Everything seems to be working fine, elements are storing and retrieving correctly. 

Added print statements to display the process of increasing array size and copying elements.
